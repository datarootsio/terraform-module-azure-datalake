This is a module for Terraform that deploys a complete and opinionated data lake network on Microsoft Azure.

## Components

* Azure Data Factory for data ingestion from various sources
* 3 or more Azure Data Lake Storage gen2 containers to store raw, clean and transformed data
* Azure Databricks to clean and transform the data
* Azure Synapse Analytics to store presentation data
* Azure CosmosDB to store metadata
* Credentials and access management configured ready to go
* Sample data pipeline (optional)

This design is based on one of Microsoft's architecture patterns for an [advanced analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/advanced-analytics-on-big-data) solution.

It includes some additional changes that [dataroots](https://dataroots.io) is recommending.

* Multiple storage containers to store every version of the data (raw, cleansed, transformed)
* Cosmos DB is used to store the metadata of the data as a Data Catalog
* Azure Analysis Services is not used for now as some services might be replaced when [Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is) becomes GA

## Usage

```hcl
module "azuredatalake" {
  source  = "datarootsio/azure-datalake/module"
  version = "~> 0.1" 

  data_lake_name = "example name"
  region         = "eastus2"

  storage_replication          = "ZRS"
  service_principal_end_date   = "2030-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  databricks_cluster_node_type = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  databricks_cluster_version   = "6.5.x-scala2.11"
  databricks_token_lifetime    = 315360000
  databricks_sku               = "standard"
  data_warehouse_dtu           = "DW100c"
  cosmosdb_consistency_level   = "Session"
  cosmosdb_db_throughput       = 400
  sql_server_admin_username    = "theboss"
  sql_server_admin_password    = "ThisIsA$ecret1"
}
```

## Requirements

### Supported environments

This module works on macOS and Linux.

### Databricks provider installation

The module is using the [Databricks Terraform provider](https://github.com/databrickslabs/databricks-terraform). This provider is not in the registry yet and would have to be installed manually. This can be done with the command below:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/databricks-terraform/master/godownloader-databricks-provider.sh | bash -s -- -b $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
```

### Azure provider configuration

The following providers have to be configured:

* [AzureRM](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html)
* [AzureAD](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azuread/index.html)

You can either log in through the Azure CLI, or set environment variables as documented in the links above.

### Azure CLI

The module uses some workarounds for features that are not yet available in the Azure providers. Therefore, you need to be logged in to the Azure CLI as well. You can use both a user account, as well as service principal authentication.

### PowerShell

The module uses some workarounds for features that are not yet available in the Azure providers. Therefore, you need to have [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) installed.

## Sample pipeline

The sample pipeline uses generated sales data. In the cleansing phase, personal information is removed and missing values are dealt with. In the transformation phase some aggregated values are calculated to show how each department and country is performing.

Finally, the data is presented in a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard cannot be deployed through Terraform, but you can find it [in the assets folder](assets/dashboard.pbix). You can follow [this guide](POWERBI.md) on how to open the report and connect it to the data lake.

## Configuration

The Azure tenant and subscription can be configured through the providers mentioned above. Please see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for all configuration options.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are very welcome! Found a bug or do you have a suggestion? Please open an issue. Do you know how to fix it? Pull requests are welcome as well! To get you started faster, a Makefile is provided.

Make sure to install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?), [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (for automated testing) and Make (optional, if you want to use the Makefile) on your computer. Install [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) to be able to run the linting.

* Setup tools & dependencies: `make tools`
* Format your code: `make fmt`
* Linting: `make lint`
* Run tests: `make test` (or `go test -timeout 2h ./...` without Make)

To run the automated tests, the environment variable `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` has to be set to your Azure subscription ID.
